# finding-pi
A Java implementation of the Gauss-Legendre algorithm for calculating pi. 
Will calculate pi to any user-specified level of precision with total accuracy


An explanation of the Gauss-Legendre algorithm, 
including the mathematical notation this script was based on,
can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Legendre_algorithm#Algorithm "Wikipedia")

The script uses the Java math library's BigDecimal object to allow any level of desired precision 

The script has now been checked out to 100,000 digits beyond the decimal place for accuracy
