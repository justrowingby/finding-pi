# finding-pi
A Java implementation of the Gauss-Legendre algorithm for calculating pi. 
Will calculate pi to any user-specified level of precision with total accuracy


An explanation of the Gauss-Legendre algorithm, 
including the mathematical notation this script was based on,
can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Legendre_algorithm#Algorithm "Wikipedia")

The script uses the Java math library's BigDecimal object to allow any level of desired precision 
(sacrificing some code readability, sadly)
